One of Scoble's recent [posts](http://scobleizer.com/2006/12/17/did-time-magazine-announce-something/trackback/) briefly mentions some announcement by Time magazine.  I think I'm going to follow his lead...the blog world is just overrun with this news ([Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) lists 700 blog links), I can understand why, but it seems a tad narcissistic.  So I'm just not going to link it myself.
