The political night continues...it'll be short, I promise :) Just got done watching [Blog Wars](http://imdb.com/title/tt0913954/) on the [Sundance Channel](http://www.sundancechannel.com/film/?ixFilmID=7594). While the title would lead one to think that it would be about the back and forth between blogs in the political world, what it turned out to be is far different. In the end it seemed more about the rise and endorsement of the left-wing bloggers then a balanced look at both sides. But still, the behind the scenes look was somewhat interesting. It could have been subtitled "How We Think The Daily Kos Is Changing Politics".
