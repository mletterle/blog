Looks like [Glenn Block](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/), from Microsoft's patterns & practices group, is now [blogging](http://codebetter.com/blogs/glenn.block/default.aspx) at CodeBetter.  I'm sure it's only a coincidence that [Scott Bellware](http://weblogs.asp.net/sbellware/) (ooold link, but only one still valid) no longer is (and had all his content removed).   


  


Update:  Glenn replied in the comments that Scott was actually the one that asked him to join CodeBetter.
