The Windows WPF Team [announced ](http://blogs.msdn.com/wpf3d/archive/2006/12/12/interacting-with-2d-on-3d-in-wpf.aspx)today the ability to use interactive 2D windows elements on WPF3D spaces, I think Tim Sneath's [blog ](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2006/12/13/new-in-wpf-build-a-true-3d-application.aspx)lays it out a little clearer though, could this be the start of true 3D applications? The mind boggles. I can't wait until I can start using this stuff at work!
