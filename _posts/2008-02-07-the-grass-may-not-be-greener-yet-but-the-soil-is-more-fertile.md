The [founder](http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/~kellyw/) of the [Ruby.NET](http://rubydotnet.googlegroups.com/web/Home.htm) project [announced](http://groups.google.com/group/RubyDOTNET/browse_thread/thread/1752830c857620b0) yesterday that he is leaving active development of that project and moving over to fully supporting the [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.com/) effort. Based on everything I've heard about Dr. Kelly and Ruby.NET, this is fantastic news. Hopefully this will spurn even more activity on the [IronRuby project](http://rubyforge.org/projects/ironruby/). Some of the important quotes from his post are:

 

<blockquote>

That's quite an endorsement. I have a feeling the next year or so will be the year of the DLR, we'll begin seeing it's API solidify with more and more languages being implemented on it.

 

That all said, IronRuby still has one major roadblock. That is the perception of it's corporate sponsor. I had another dev tell me this today:

 

<blockquote>

[John Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/) say it ain't so...

 

The [ironruby-core mailing list](http://www.rubyforge.org/pipermail/ironruby-core/) is fairly active, and the [MS-PL is OSI approved](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2007/10/two-microsoft-licenses-now-osi-approved.html). Yet, Microsoft _has_ to **actively** be promoting these things, otherwise the outside perception will not change and IronRuby will be the less for it I fear.

 

What IronRuby needs more than anything right now is a large group of outside contributors, so come on down and get coding, testing, and documenting!
