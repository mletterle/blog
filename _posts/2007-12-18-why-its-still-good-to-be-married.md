Since I just switched jobs and my previous employer paid me due vacation time, we had a little extra cash in our coffers. My [aforementioned wife](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-it-good-to-be-married.html) suggested I get myself an early Christmas present. As you can no doubt tell by the [GamerCard](http://live.xbox.com/member/Judiah) on the site, I am now the proud owner of a Xbox 360 Elite. I was also able to pick up the HDDVD drive. Though unlike the list earlier in the year I did not get the wireless adapter nor Gears of War. I had already gotten a wireless bridge for the PS2, so connectivity was no issue. I ended up getting [Assassin's Creed](http://www.ubi.com/US/Games/Info.aspx?pId=5919), as well as the [Serenity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/) HD-DVD. Feel free to send me a friend's request on XBox LIVE. Which, by the way, is everything I had hoped. Between the marketplace and the arcade it's nothing short of awesome. The XBox itself makes a wonderful media extender. I tried Windows Media Center, but quickly dropped it in favor of [TVersity](http://www.tversity.com/home). Check it out! Now that I'm settled in at my new job, be on the look out for some blog posts in the coming days...
