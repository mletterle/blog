[It's](http://www.codemash.org/) a week from today!  And now they have a [Google Group](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/codemash) set up, already 50 people are members and the conversation is starting.  We're Mashing up before the Mashing, ha!  I'm looking so forward to this, and [Dianne](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2007/01/lament-of-those-who-cannot-go.html#comments)...do you think we could get an Adult Entertainment Expo next door at the last minute?  Pretty Please?  Anyway, get in the group and start meeting your fellow attendees ahead of time.
