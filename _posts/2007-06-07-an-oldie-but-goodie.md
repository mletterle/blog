Back in the day I used [CrimsonEditor](http://www.crimsoneditor.com/) alot, it was a good, free source code editor.  Unfortunately it was a one man job and the developer stopped maintaining the application in late 2004.  Enter the [EmeraldEditor](http://www.emeraldeditor.com/) group!  EmeraldEditor intends to be a new CrimsonEditor-like editor (ugh that's an awkward scentence), written to be cross-platform and open source.  But the news gets better, CrimsonEditor _itself_ was open sourced by it's author and the EE team has effectively taken over maintenance of it! So grab the [code](http://svn.emeraldeditor.com/viewvc.cgi/CrimsonEditor/) and get cracking!  I'm glad to have CrimsonEditor back and look forward to EmeraldEditor.
