Why?  Simple, because they can do something [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) can't or won't.  [Bring  competitors together](http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/).  Google AND Yahoo together on stage!  Who would have  thought it?  With Microsoft [screwing their partners,](http://www.computerworld.com/blogs/node/4302)  while Apple is brining competitors together, one has to wonder how long until  Microsoft implodes.  Apple is shrewd indeed.  They talk like the iPhone is  competing with cell phones, when what it's really competing with is Microsoft's  [UMPC](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/umpc/default.mspx)  initiative.  What we have is not a phone, but an ultra portable computing  platform.  It just happens to make calls.  So Apple beat Microsoft's [Zune ](http://www.zune.net/en-US/)with the [iPod ](http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html)and  is now going to beat Microsoft's UMPC with the iPhone.   The only way Microsoft will win is  through sheer force of will (and dollars), which is not to be discounted in this  case.   Bill has to be fuming.
