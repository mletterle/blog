Just a heads up to my faithful readership, Iâ€™ll be speaking about [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.com) at [erubycon](http://www.erubycon.com) this August. It'll be my first [![](http://www.erubycon.com/images/banner_small_speaker.png)](http://www.erubycon.com/index.html)public speaking engagement at a technical conference, and my first real public speaking since High School (in-house presentations don't count in my book). I'm quite nervous but it's a topic I'm passionate about so I'm really excited as well. The title of the talk is_ "Because Iron is Battleship Gray: IronRuby In The Real World"_, and it won't mention [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/default.aspx) or [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/). Ruby is so much more than glitz and glam, and I think that tends to get lost in the hype. She's a sexy lady, but she's got brains too! 

 

Hope to see you there!
