As Teresa [points out](http://teresacentric.com/2006/12/the-same-old-men/trackback/) on her blog, the same old men (and women, of both parties) have been in charge of the country for a long time. According to the [Congressional Research Service](http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RS22007.pdf) the 109th Congress was the oldest  in history (average age 56 years (Senators averaged over 60 years! (Representatives averaged 55))).  When you consider that the minimum ages for Representatives and Senators are 25 and 30 respectively, then you get some idea how long these people have been running the country.  In fact the longest serving congressman is John Dingell, Democrat Representative from Michigan.  Mr. Dingell first took office in 1955.  That's over 50 years!  The founding fathers never imagined congressional terms this long.  They believed in the citizen congress.  Congressmen were meant to serve few terms and then return to their professions, politics where not meant to _be_ their profession.  

Obviously it's time for some young blood, from both sides of the aisle.   [John Edwards](http://blog.johnedwards.com/) has [shown](http://scobleizer.com/2006/12/27/full-disclosure/) that the time of the young, internet savvy politician is, if not here, at least close at hand.   Given that Al Gore invented it, it's not surprising that Democrats/Liberals are often viewed as more internet savvy then their peers.  Though being young and Democrat [doesn't automatically mean you're an internet expert](http://www.searchmarketinggurus.com/search_marketing_gurus/2006/12/barack_obama_do.html). 

But at least the Democrat's have _somebody**.  **_Where is the internet savvy Republican/Conservative?   Contrary to the popular wisdom; there are [plenty](http://www.usrbingeek.com/) of [small-government-wanting](http://michellemalkin.com/index.htm), [personal-responsibility-believing](http://www.dailypundit.com/), technically [savvy people out there](http://camedwards.com/).  Why aren't any in politics?  Are they too intelligent?  Is John Edwards simply the [smartest](http://www.quoteworld.org/quotes/4583) [idiot](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=politician+idiot&btnG=Search)?  I would be very interested to see how a internet wise conservative candidate (Republican or third party) would play out,  I think the results would surprise a few people.  If anyone knows of such a person, _please_ let me know.
