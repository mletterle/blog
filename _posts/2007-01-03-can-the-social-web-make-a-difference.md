[Rex](http://rexduffdixon.com/) (I hope he doesn't mind me calling him Rex) [pointed](http://rexduffdixon.com/?p=1214) me to [this](http://8wishes.blogspot.com/) site.  The [aim](http://8wishes.blogspot.com/2006/12/8-wishes-1-raise-1-million-dollars-i.html) is to raise a million dollars in 30 days for kids with dyslexia and learning disabilities.  A worthy cause, make sure you [digg the article](http://digg.com/tech_news/Using_the_power_of_social_media_to_help_a_great_cause_8_wishes) so we can get the word out.  I think Rex brings up a bigger question as well, can the Social Web truly make a difference?  Is it big enough, and well connected enough, to really have an impact in the lives of those who are not a part of it?  I think the answer is yes myself.  And if it's not currently, it's certainly heading in that direction.  Unfortunately this is the first I had heard of 8wishes and their self-imposed deadline is in a week.  So hurry up and get the word out!
