Just got back from the expert panel on languages, it was most enjoyable.  I think they did a pretty good job.  I would say Bruce Eckle and Neal Ford pretty much stole the show, but everyone was very informative and entertaining.  One of the interesting things I heard was the rise of Domain Specific Languages, something that's been rattling around in the back of my head for work. The only real complaint so far is the wireless connection, it does to drop alot. For instance I've been fighting to upload pictures to flickr for almost a whole hour.  Anyway, I've been taking pictures, [here's the flickr link](http://www.flickr.com/photos/38351216@N00/sets/72157594485870926/).  Feel free to tag 'em up!
