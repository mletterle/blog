Marcel Ortiz and Satish Mathew of the Windows [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx) team posted [this powershell script](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2006/12/21/jingle.aspx) on the powershell blog yesterday.  Save the script as a ps1 file, open up PowerShell and run.  You'll be quickly in the spirt!  If you don't have PowerShell, download it [here](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/download.mspx).  Then we have ["Software Wonderland"](http://blogs.msdn.com/micahel/archive/2006/12/20/Software-Wonderland.aspx) from The Braidy Tester.  [WillItBlend](http://www.willitblend.com/) asks if you want to [drink your Christmas dinner](http://www.willitblend.com/videos.aspx?type=unsafe&video=christmasdinner). And last but not least, [Happy Holidays To You!](http://www.geogreeting.com/view.html?zdCW33*x+gHlUa.M+izFyWp9+fPOWVgh+EnYl)  What geeky ways are you celebrating the season?
