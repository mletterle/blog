Microsoft [announced ](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/dec06/12-13SantaIMPR.mspx)today that the one and only Santa Claus was going to be available for live chatting exclusively on their Windows Live Messenger service.  It's amazing to see the changes that occur to things within one's own lifetime.  When I was a good the thought of a "modernized" Santa wasn't really widely thought of.  Now he's using IM to chat with the kiddies...AND he has a [blog ](http://santaonspaces.spaces.live.com/)(though Manga Santa is scary)!  Simply amazing.
