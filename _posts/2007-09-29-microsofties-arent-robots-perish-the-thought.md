[Glenn Bock](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock) over at Microsoft recently [blogged](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2007/09/22/i-am-not-a-robot.aspx) that he was not a robot because he uses the following non-Microsoft technologies: A Mac Mini (which really doesn't count, Microsoft doesn't make computers and as far as I am aware they still write software for the Mac), an iPod, Yahoo, Google, NUnit (MS tech related), Firefox, OpenSource, Resharper (MS tech related), Ruby on Rails, and Linux. That's all well and good, but would he still follow the [Programming Promises](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2007/01/programming-promises.html)? I bet he at least tries, though I'd also guess he's a tad biased. :) Regardless he's also right in he wouldn't be doing a good job if he wasn't examining and using alternatives, especially when they were better then the items he could dogfood. It's a reminder that we all need to continually be exploring and expanding our exposure to technology from all fronts.
