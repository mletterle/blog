I had the pleasure of being [interviewed](http://altnetpodcast.com/episodes/9-state-of-ironruby) along side [Aaron Junod](http://rubydoes.net/) on the [Alt.NET Podcast](http://altnetpodcast.com/) to discuss [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net).  ![altdotnetmike](http://blog.prokrams.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/altdotnetmike.png)

[Michael  Moore](http://blowmage.com/) was a wonderful host and did an amazing job editing the conversation down to something tight.  It was an exciting opportunity to talk about IronRuby specifically and Ruby in general.  Hopefully it will help spark even more interest in it.

On a personal note, I’m interested in any feedback you might have, from the technical to the stylistic. It was my first time doing a podcast, so it’s definitely a learning experience for me.
