Thanks to [Christopher Grant](http://cgrant.wordpress.com/) for pointing out that CodeMash moved from [#2 on Technorati's search](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2007/01/codemash-number-2-search-on-technorati.html) to #1:

Amazing!  That kind of exposure can only be a good thing for this unique and wonderful conference.
