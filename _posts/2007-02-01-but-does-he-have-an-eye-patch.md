Looks like someone was trying to [make a buck off of Microsoft and Adobe](http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/02/01/HNcaliforniaarrestspirate_1.html).  Microsoft is [heaping praise](http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/jan07/SoftwarePiracyArrestPR.mspx) on the Sheriff department for making the arrest.  I especially like the name of the task force: "Computer And Technology Crime High-Tech Response".  "High-Tech Response" sounds like they should have friggen laser beams on their heads.  

Apparently the guy made three quarters of a million dollars selling SQL Server and Creative Suite 2 on eBay (excuse me "online auction sites"). [Of course Microsoft](http://www.smh.com.au/news/Technology/Microsoft-Profit-Down-Beats-Estimates/2007/01/26/1169594466190.html) [makes $750, 000 every 37 minutes](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=2.63+billion+dollars+%2F+3+months&btnG=Search). So that's a major criminal off the streets.  

They're calling this a "mid-level" piracy operation.  It was one guy selling two products online....I think they may be overstating it just a bit.  I'd expect a "mid-level" operation to having three or more people and be making a couple million a year.  But then I'm not in copyright enforcement. 

The thing that really surprised me is the guy was 64 years old.  I could see if it was some punk kid, but the guy should have known better.  One thing I do know is that he's praying he doesn't end up in Federal Pound-Me-In-The-Ass Prison.
