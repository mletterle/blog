[Or at least one employee does.](http://blogs.msdn.com/ptorr/archive/2007/09/30/wikipedia-editing.aspx) Peter Torr, a program manager at Microsoft, admits to editing Wikipedia articles on HD-DVD in order to "[keep] the pages interesting, up-to-date, and _accurate_". He also comes clean about doing a bit of anonymous editing in the past and states he created a [Wikipedia account](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Petertorr) so noone can "stumble" on his edits and accuse Microsoft of astroturfing or such. [Which of course people will.](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2007/01/is-it-astroturfing-even-when-it-really.html) I personally applaud Peter for being upfront with his editing, it will be up to the users of Wikipedia to decide if his comments are biased or not. I would encourage Microsoft to make a standard corporate Wikipedia account that their employees should use if they want to edit Wikipedia. Or establish a policy that they must create a MSFT* user or some-such. Though most companies are becoming transparent [wither they want to or not](http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/08/wiki_tracker), thanks to [WikiScanner](http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/). Regardless, another sign that Microsoft is more open then people give them credit for.
