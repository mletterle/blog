Sorry for the lack of postings, work has been kicking my butt.  We have an important client coming up so my energies have been pretty focused on that.  But there have been a few things I've noticed going on around the net.

[Carlos Men'steal'ia vs Joe Rogan](http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&article=53945)

Joe Rogan is my new favourite person just for the utter way he destroys Carlos.  At a deeper level though it's an interesting allegory for intellectual property rights.  There's ideas and then there's implementation.  It's one thing to take an idea and expound upon it, it's another to steal an implementation outright. (as an aside Microsoft's spell checker recommends "Menstrual" to replace "Men'steal'ia").

[Give Me A Friggin' Break](http://givemeafrigginbreak.com/gmafb/)

Rex Dixon & Scot Duke's new site.  It's kind of like digg but with a satirical twist.  Have you ever seen something that made you go "Give me a friggin' break!"?  Well here's your chance to share it with the world.  It's a fairly well done site that's gone through some cosmetic changes since it's been launched, I'd wager it'll go through a few more, but the idea is a good one I think.

[Havidol](http://www.havidol.com/)

Is something missing from your life?  Feel like all your material possessions you've acquired isn't enough?  Do you want more then more?  Perhaps Havidol is right for you.  Take the [self assessment](http://www.havidol.com/zing.html) and find out!

[GMAiL.pl](http://www.physorg.com/news90864387.html)

So much for that "Do No Evil" slogan.  I [still think](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-2007-end-of-google-era.html) this may be the year that Google looses it's luster.  With all the bad press the time may be ripe for a new geek friendly search engine to take the throne.  Remember, it was word of mouth that made Google, it can break them just as easy.

[Always A Bridesmaid](http://www.nascar.com/2007/news/headlines/cup/02/18/daytona.500.results.ap/index.html)

Poor Mark Martin.  He's literally within seconds of winning the Daytona 500, and up comes Happy to steal it from him.  He's the eternal runner up.  Nice guys don't finish last, but they do finish second alot.  I wonder if there'll be a backlash against Harvick, regardless his late run was amazing.  I'm more upset at NASCAR for not throwing the caution.
