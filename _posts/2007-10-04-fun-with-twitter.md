[Dan Hounshell](http://danhounshell.com) [announced](http://danhounshell.com/blogs/dan/archive/2007/10/03/more-twitter-fun-randomtweets-com.aspx) his new little side project [RandomTweets](http://randomtweets.com/). Basically it's similar to [bash.org](http://bash.org) or [qdb.us](http://qdb.us) but for [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com). Right now Dan is using the API to pull random tweets and then manually sorting through them for humor or inspirational value. He states his intention is to make the site more community driven in the future, but he's got some pretty funny stuff up there already. [You should check it out](http://www.randomtweets.com)!
