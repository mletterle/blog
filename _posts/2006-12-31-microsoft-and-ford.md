It looks like [Ford is partnering with Microsoft](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nf/20061229/tc_nf/49018) to release a new autocomputing platform next year. Since I bleed Ford Blue, and will be needing a new car soon, this is exciting news. I hope my Escort lasts one more year so I'm not limited to the [Focus](http://www.fordvehicles.com/cars/focus/) or the [Five-Hundred](http://www.fordvehicles.com/cars/fivehundred/). Oh, and please hold the "Fix Or Reboot Daily" jokes.
