Ah the first real blog post in a while, and even this is late, hoping to get back in the groove here with this one!

After leaving Cleveland at 6am I ended up arriving at Day Of DotNet a little late.  Not too bad for a three hundred mile drive, I ended up walking into [Josh Holmes'](http://www.joshholmes.com/default.aspx) talk on "Architecting the User Experience" (part of the [ArcReady](http://www.arcready.com/#1) series, this was like a sneak-peek) about 10 minutes late.  What I saw was awesome though , definitely some things to think about.  [Jason Follas](http://jasonf-blog.blogspot.com/), who I met at [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/) and an organizer for DoDN, was kind enough to grab my name tag for me in exchange for me doing a head count of the session (76 people if you're curious).  

After having a few minutes to mull over what I had heard, it was time for the next session.  "Hardcore Reflection" by [Dustin Campbell.](http://www.diditwith.net/)  This was by far the **_most_** valuable session of the the day, for me.  Dustin was a great speaker and really knew his stuff.  I learned alot there that I'm looking forward to using in my day to day work.  

I then had a chance to attend [red-gate Software's](http://www.red-gate.com/) vendor session, mostly a bore-fest infomercial.  Then Lunch, Domino's pizza (if you could get it), I had a couple pizza's and called the wife.  

Off to "Next Generation UI" session by [Mark Miller.](http://www.doitwith.net/)  Poor guy, his speaking skills are awesome, but the technology did not want to cooperate!  I heard his second session went well, but I had opted to go to "Multithreading in Windows Forms Applications".  [Patrick Steele](http://weblogs.asp.net/psteele/) gave a good talk on the basics of multi-threading a form application, I was hoping for something more in depth, but all in all a good refresher.  

Then we had the [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) Vendor Session, which was also hosted by Josh Holmes, he didn't have anything prepared so I threw out the [DLR](http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/archive/2007/04/30/a-dynamic-language-runtime-dlr.aspx) and [IronRuby](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/04/introducing_iro.html).  Well, he didn't have IronRuby, but we got to see some of the DLR in Silverlight 1.1 with IronPython, cool stuff!  Someone asked about Silverlight on Linux ([which Mono is working on).](http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight)  Josh said that if it made business sense Microsoft would do it (being that they're a business and all), but he didn't think that the Linux made much business sense right now.  He's probably right (though I did rib him a bit about [Dell putting Ubuntu](http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/ubuntu?c=us&cs=19&amp;l=en&) on consumer systems now), but sometimes developer and community good will pays more then a strict bean counter could see.  Could you imagine if Microsoft announced Linux support for Silverlight?  I think it would be a brilliant PR move myself.  You keep saying your open and look at these cool standards and we're cross platform, and blah blah blah.  Just do it already! :)  

Anyway, wrapped up the day with [Brian Prince's](http://brianhprince.blogspot.com/) talk on "Agile Processes", I didn't get a chance to hear Brian speak at CodeMash, and I must say I came away impressed.  He's quite an awesome presenter!  I hope to incorporate some of his company's ideas into my own practices, and at least I'll be more prepared if I ever get a job at an agile shop.

I was glad I went, I learned alot and had a great amount of fun and will be attending the next one!  We need more events like this in the Northeast Ohio area!
