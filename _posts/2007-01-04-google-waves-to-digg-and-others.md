With yesterday's [post](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-like-big-charts-and-i-cannot-lie.html) from the [googlereader blog](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/) detailing how they've added the new personal stats feature, a [number](http://www.usrbingeek.com/a/000833.php) of [people](http://www.micropersuasion.com/2007/01/google_reader_t.html) have speculated on Google releasing the information in an aggregate form.  As speculated [earlier](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2006/12/google-vs-digg.html) on this blog and others, Google may be in a position to compete in the social web with the likes of Digg.  Of course this would require aggregate data on individual posts (which I'm sure they're gathering).  Another site that Google could easily compete with would be [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/), the stats that they're currently showing are for individual feeds, which usually correspond to an individual site.  It would be trivial to provide a listing of most read and most shared feeds, _those_ would be some interesting stats I think.  Maybe call it Feedorati?  Regardless, I'm expecting with 2007 to be the year of the Social Web that Google will be adding alot more social aspects to their services, and this is likely a step in that direction.
