While the question may be ironic on this blog (note the domain), it looks  like Blogspot may be having some problems, there's a number of blogs I can't  access today, inlcuding [http://ohiomedia.blogspot.com](http://ohiomedia.blogspot.com/).   Indeed Google's very own blog [Buzz](http://buzz.blogspot.com/) seems  to be down.  Here's hoping I stay up long enough to send the word out...

  


  


Note:  I couldn't use Live Writer to send this... and it took forever for the dashboard to come up....something's wrong..
