[Blake Ross](http://www.blakeross.com/) [pointed](http://www.blakeross.com/2007/01/16/rock-the-vote/) out that [Rock The Vote](http://www.rockthevote.com/) is honoring the [Good Dr. King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.) by linking to a site which, under even a cursory examination, is obviously a hate site.  This is a good lesson and reminder to always double check every thing you plan on posting before you blare it out on the net for all to see.  Failing to do that may have cost one webmaster his job.

  


  


**UPDATE: 1/17/07@8:40am** Looks like they finally fixed their link.  It now points to [The King Center](http://www.thekingcenter.org/tkc/index.asp).  Took them long enough.  And one has to wonder...why didn't they just do that in the first place?
