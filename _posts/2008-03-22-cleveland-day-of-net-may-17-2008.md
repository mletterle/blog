[![badge](http://blog.prokrams.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/badge.png)](http://www.clevelanddodn.org)Earlier today the [website](http://www.clevelanddodn.org/) went live and registrations started.  What is a "Day of .NET"?  And why is it happening in Cleveland?  A "Day of .NET" is, as the [Day of .NET website](http://www.dodn.org/) says, "a one-day conference on all things .NET organized by developers for developers."  And that last part is why it's happening in Cleveland.  A number of us have frankly been tired of nothing happening in the Cleveland/North East Ohio area, and decided to take the bull by the horns as it were.

One of the themes we're trying to push is that Day of .NET is .NET centric, but not .NET exclusive.  So we're hoping to bring a few speakers from other worlds (Java, Ruby, Python, etc) and learn from them.  As well as explore a number of the exciting new things coming out of Microsoft these days (like the DLR, Silverlight, et. al.).

Interested in speaking?  Contact [speakers@clevelanddodn.org](mailto:speakers@clevelanddodn.org).  Want to sponsor or know someone who would want to sponsor?  We got lot's of logo space to fill up, just contact [sponsors@clevelanddodn.org](mailto:sponsors@clevelanddodn.org).   Most of all, get to [www.clevelanddodn.org](http://www.clevelanddodn.org) and register!
