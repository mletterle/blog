    Christmas was very enjoyable.  Since Marissa doesn't have to be on the [apnea monitor](http://smartmonitor2.respironics.com/) 24/7 any more we got to take her out an about.  The resulting activity caused her to sleep very well over the night!  I also got my first chance to play the [Nintendo Wii](http://us.wii.com/) first hand, it really is a different experince.  [Wii Sports](http://us.wii.com/soft_wii_sports.jsp) shows off the console and control schemes very well I think.  It's also quite a work out in the end!  [Twillight Princess](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FQBPCQ) is enjoyable, but not quite as revolutionary as Wii Sports I think.  The channels show real promise, but there's not alot there, browsing with the [Opera browser (trial edition)](http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2006/12/22/) is suprisingly enjoyable and functional ([Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) on the TV is a sight to behold).

    In the Technology arena we have the whole [Wikiasari](http://search.wikia.com/wiki/Search_Wikia) news hitting, seems the founder of Wikipedia is setting out to revolutionize searching. [TechCrunch posted a screenshot](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/25/the-wikisearch-screen-shot-isnt-wikiasari-so-what-is-it/) that purported to be an early beta of the service, but Jimmy Wales denied it's related to Wikiasari.  Has one of TechCrunch's readers pointed out to them, the screenshot seems to be from [this](http://www.searchme.com/beta/) site.  As [Michael Arrignton](http://www.crunchnotes.com/) asks, if WikiSearch isn't Wikiasari...what is it?  And will Wikiasari contribute to the [end of the Google Era](http://michaeldotnet.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-2007-end-of-google-era.html)?  2007 looks to be the year alot of sites go mainstream.  Youtube [get's sponsored by Chevy](http://mashable.com/2006/12/26/youtube-new-year/), and Myspace [get's used by the Colts](http://mashable.com/2006/12/26/colts-myspace-slideshow/).   The next week or two should be interesting...
