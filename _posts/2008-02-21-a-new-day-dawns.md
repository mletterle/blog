Microsoft is [releasing the majority of their API](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/21/microsoft_api_open/) and [promising not to sue OpenSource](http://www.news.com/8301-13860_3-9876029-56.html?tag=nefd.lede) for interoperability. It's brought of a "broad interoperability strategy".

 

All I can say is. Wow. If this is even half of what comes from all of this, Microsoft is no longer the one we all knew, real changes are being effected from inside. Once I see the full details, I'll post more complete thoughts. Details on the conference call [here](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-21NewsConferenceMA.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases).
