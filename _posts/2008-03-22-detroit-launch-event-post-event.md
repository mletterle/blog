Tuesday (3/18) was the [Microsoft Launch event](http://www.microsoft.com/heroeshappenhere/default.mspx) in Detroit. Being the intrepid geek I am, I decided to take a [road trip](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=Cleveland,+OH&daddr=Detroit,+MI&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=34.724817,82.265625&ie=UTF8&z=9) and go to the event 3 hours away, rather then the one in the same town a week earlier. Madness you say? Nay, for I [![](http://www.pizzapapalis.com/images/specials/store_12.jpg)](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=Cleveland,+OH&daddr=Detroit,+MI&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=34.724817,82.265625&ie=UTF8&z=9)got to enjoy the good company of [Corey Haines](http://www.coreyhaines.com/coreysramblings/) and [Nate Hoellein](http://diditwith.net/ct.ashx?id=ecbac45b-45eb-4498-b372-27a9a2d39764&url=http%3a%2f%2fnatehoellein.blogspot.com%2f) on the way there and back as we car polled together. While leaving at 4:30am was a bit rough, the drive was worth it once we got there. I got to interact with a slew of smart people that I get to see far to rarely. [Dustin Campbell](http://www.diditwith.net/) has a good [list of everyone](http://diditwith.net/2008/03/19/DetroitLaunchEvent.aspx) I ran into there (don't worry Dustin, your secret of feeling up Jeff at lunch is safe with me). 

 

The event du jour however was by far the [Geek Dinner](http://keithelder.net/blog/archive/2008/02/05/Detroit-MI-Geek-Dinner-March-18th.aspx) put on by [Keith Elder](http://keithelder.net), and generously sponsored by the Microsoft Visual Studio Team System..err. . Team. If you're ever in downtown Detroit and looking for some _killer_ deep dish and wings, I can't recommend [PizzaPapalis](http://www.pizzapapalis.com/) enough.

 

After a cold beer and some hot pizza, it was time to take the long haul back to Cleveland. Corey did a fantastic job getting us through the fog alive, and by the time I hit the bed around midnight I was more then ready for sleep.
