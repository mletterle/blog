I guess I should explain the picture in the upper right hand part of the page.  [CodeMash ](http://www.codemash.org/default.aspx)a development conference that's actually taking place in the midwest!  These things never happen close to where I live and this is right down the highway in Sandusky, Ohio!  [CodeMash ](http://www.codemash.org/default.aspx)is a way for developers of different backgrounds a chance to mingle, I look forward to learning something new. And at $99 you can NOT beat the price.  If you still need to convince your employer that you need to go I HIGHLY recommend [this ](http://frazzleddad.blogspot.com/2006/11/why-conferences-matter-and-how-to.html)blog post from Jim Holmes one of the founders, he lays the case out pretty well.  And if you still need convincing..it's at the [Kalahari Resort](http://www.kalahariresort.com/)!
