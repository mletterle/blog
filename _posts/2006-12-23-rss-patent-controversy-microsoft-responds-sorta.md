<blockquote>Sean Lyndersay, Program Manager Lead for RSS at Microsoft, has [responded](http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2006/12/23/patent-applications-in-the-rss-space.aspx) to the [RSS Patent Flap.](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2006/12/microsoft_tries.html)   Microsoft is essentially saying: "We only patented what we feel is some cool additions we invented, we promise not to try and take over RSS."  [Niall Kennedy](http://www.niallkennedy.com/) has a good [in-depth analysis of the patent application](http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/12/microsoft-feed-platform-patent-review.html) which essentially says "Most of this stuff is all obvious prior art, there's a few new ideas, but not many."  He also asks the scary question of "What other "inventions" are yet to be unveiled as the patent system's 18-month privacy rolls forward?".
