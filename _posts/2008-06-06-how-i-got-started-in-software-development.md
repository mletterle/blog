[Michael Eaton](http://www.michaeleatonconsulting.com/blog/) started [it](http://michaeleatonconsulting.com/blog/archive/2008/06/04/how-did-you-get-started-in-software-development.aspx), and others took off and ran with it.  Now it’s a certified [meme](http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/meme.html). So I guess I might as well join in the fray and relate the beginnings of my geekdom.

## A Long, Long Time Ago…


How old were you when you started programming?

I was about 7ish when I first started. Read on for more details…

How did you you get started in programming?

When I was around 7, my uncle had an [Atari 400](http://www.myoldcomputers.com/museum/comp/atari400.htm).  I initially just played games on it, but one day I noticed a stack of [Byte magazines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)) in the corner.  Inside this magazine was source code, it said it was “BASIC” and needed to be typed in… hmm.. there’s this [Atari-BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_BASIC) cartridge, and there’s a keyboard.  A light went off, I can make this machine /do/ something?  So I typed in the program, saved it to the cassette drive, and then tweaked it.

Next thing I know I’m begging my parent’s for a computer.  For my 8th birthday I got an [Atari 65XE](http://www.computercloset.org/atari65xe.htm) and a couple of BASIC games books, and I’ve been totally hooked ever since.  Time passed, and eventually I got into things like QBASIC, DOS Batch, and C/C++ (via an old copy of [TurboC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C) a friend loaned me).  Then in high school someone gave me a Linux CD and having a whole slew of development tools really helped.

I just kept hacking away…

What’s the most fun you’ve ever had … programming?

Staying awake for 48 hours straight and hacking an ANSI art viewer in C with [Jim Balcomb](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=16084237).  We were probably 15 and 16 at the time and just didn’t need to rest when programming was to be had.  I think it’d kill me today.  Oh yeah, and then I delivered papers in the morning after being jacked up on coffee and Jolt and my father was convinced I was on speed…

## Googoo gah gah?


What was your first language?

Well it was BASIC obviously, from Atari-BASIC, to BASICA, to QBasic, eventually to QuickBasic…

What was the first real program you wrote?

One that really stands out was a grading program I wrote in high school for the Learning department at the school.  It was all done in QBasic and had menus that were keyboard driven, grid data entry, and a printing subsystem.  I wish I still had that code…

What languages have you used since you started programming?

Define use? Here are all the languages I have written something of some complexity in:



	
  * [AutoIT](http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/) (don’t ask…)

	
  * Bash Shell

	
  * BASIC (variations there of)

	
  * C/C++

	
  * C#

	
  * DOS Batch

	
  * JavaScript

	
  * PHP

	
  * Ruby

	
  * TSQL (don’t ask)


..and [Insert Deity Here] knows what else…

What was your first programming gig?

I’ve always loved programming, and have been doing it has a hobbyist since as far back as I can remember.  However, without experience (and never having finished college) I was never able to really get a foot in the door.  I worked in support at [Harley-Davidson Dealer Systems](http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/Career_Opportunities/loc_valley_view.jsp?locale=en_US) for 6 years and had a chance to do some development work (I had written a number of utilities for support including [SetPrinter](http://setuserprinter.sourceforge.net/)) I jumped at the opportunity.  I actually took a “demotion” from Team Lead to Developer for the chance.

After a couple years of doing development work there I had pretty much tapped out all I could do and was stuck, that’s when I was introduced to [PreEmptive Solutions](http://www.preemptive.com) and am currently doing development there.  My work at PreEmptive is much more like a “real” development job then HDDS.  At HDDS I was pretty much a cowboy left on my own.  Here I’m working with a true development team.

If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?

Oh hell yes, I truly believe I was born to be a computer programmer, I can imagine doing nothing else.

If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?

RTFM.


## Thanks Mike!


A big thank you to [Mike Eaton](http://michaeleatonconsulting.com/blog/) for getting the ball rolling on this, it’s fascinating to see how my fellow [tweeps](http://www.twitter.com) and hackers got started.  I’m not going to “tag” anyone, because that’s silly, but I do encourage anyone who reads this post to do the same and link back to mike’s blog, he’s keeping a list of people responding!
