North East Ohio seems to suffer from a dearth of good Developer centric events. And the events we do get seem to be poorly advertised. And the developers who would be interested in planning and implementing events can often have a hard time finding like minded souls. To help alleviate both problems, I am implementing the North East Ohio Developer Events [blog](http://neodevevents.blogspot.com/) and [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/neodevevents). The [blog](http://neodevevents.blogspot.com/) is intended as a place where North East Ohio based developers can hear about upcoming events that may interest them, while the [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/neodevevents) is a place where those passionate North East Ohio developers can collaborate and plan events. I'm hoping that we can really get some activity going in this region, I truly think it's under appreciated, and I know [others feel as I do](http://tocode.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-does-cleveland-get-shaft.html). The [blog](http://neodevevents.blogspot.com/) kicks off with details on the next Cleveland [ArcReady](http://www.arcready.com) event. I hear word of an upcoming [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/), with other talk of a [Code Camp](http://blogs.msdn.com/trobbins/archive/2004/12/12/280181.aspx) and rumors of a possible [DevCares](http://www.msdnevents.com/devcares/) event both in the near future. As I get details they will be announced on the [NEODevEvent blog.](http://neodevevents.blogspot.com/)
