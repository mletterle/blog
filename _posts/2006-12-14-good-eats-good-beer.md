Today was the holiday lunch meeting for my department at work.  It's a very nice time, usually we go some place nice, last year it was [Dave&Buster;'s](http://www.daveandbusters.com/?f=0), this year we went to [Claddagh Irish Pub](http://www.claddaghirishpubs.com/index.php).  Very nice atmosphere, it has a nice brick and stained glass motif that really lends something to the experience.  They also have a nice selection of Irish beer, I enjoyed a good [Smithwick's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithwicks) with a Corned Beef and Slaw sandwich.  The manager took time to go through everyone in the department and relay what their accomplishments were, so it was a good feeling to hear your name and be recognized.  The two beers didn't hurt either.  Twas a good day :)
