[Scott's](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) keynote on [LINQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query) was very cool.  The concept of using specific keywords for data access (the _what_ not the _how_) is one of those things that when you see it, you ask why noone's really done it before.  I hope other languages and platforms really do pick it up and run with it.

After the keynote I headed to Lean Software Development presented by [Mary Poppendieck](http://www.poppendieck.com/), which was a great talk and very thought provoking.  I look forward to reading some of the books she recommended and at least attempting to put some of the techniques described in practice.

Luckily [Bill Wagner's](http://www.srtsolutions.com/public/blog/20574) talk, an Introduction to Functional Programming, was in the same room so I got to just hang out while they set up for that.  Bill's talk was quite a compliment to Scott's keynote.  Bill really showed the power of the LINQ syntax when used against objects and while implementing [lambdas.](http://blogs.msdn.com/abhinaba/archive/2005/09/17/469568.aspx)  Very cool stuff, I really need to move away from .NET 1.1 as soon as possible.

After that was Lunch, where we got to see [Drew Robbin's](http://drewby.spaces.live.com/) first [python program](http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeldotnet/363697982/) as they randomly selected the Blogging contest winner (twasn't me).  I've seen a couple people complain about the lunches, but for me it was more then good enough.  If people _really_ wanted a full blown meal there were restaurants in the resort.  And if box lunches keep the price down, then I say change nothing! 

Anywho, after lunch it was off to Neal Ford's talk on The Productive Programmer.  It was amusing to watch him [drink coke out of a pepsi bottle,](http://objo.com/2007/1/6/drinking-coke-out-of-a-pepsi-bottle) but the talk was very good.  I was happy to see that I was already doing alot of the things he discussed (and can't imagine people NOT doing), but there were alot of utilities and subtle tricks he brought up that I will be sure to use.  I look forward to the book!

Then it was on to the last session of the conference (for me), [Jim Holmes'](http://frazzleddad.blogspot.com/) presentation on "Improving your testing with Open Source Testing Tools".  Lot's of good stuff, and since I hadn't really been introduced to unit testing and what not before, this talk was very interesting.  Fortunately I was able to trade in the book I received at the end of mash giveaway for a book on C# and NUnit.  Which should be useful.

Speaking of the end of  CodeMash meeting, I ended up coming in second place in [Pillar's](http://www.pillartechnology.com/) CodeOff challenge.  I'm sure I'll put the gift card to full use.  The object was to move a company of 100 employees from a building of four floors to a building of six floors while minimizing costs and keeping product teams together.  My entry is [here](http://www.prokrams.com/%7Emichael/EmployeeMove.cs), if you're interested.

We also got to see [Brian Prince](http://brianhprince.blogspot.com/) and [Josh Holmes](http://blogs.msdn.com/joshholmes/) [shave their heads](http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeldotnet/363699736/)! That was exciting, even though we didn't quite get 500 blog posts in the time allotted, I think we did pretty good and Brian and Josh were awesome about it (I hope Brian's wife forgives him!).

I must say this was a very awesome experience and I would have never met the people I met or learned the things I learned anywhere else.  Thank you for all the organizers for putting on such a great conference, and for just being cool people and to all the speakers I heard and had the honor of hanging out with (even though I'm just an annoying newb). I look very forward to CodeMash 2.0.08 and plan on being there!
