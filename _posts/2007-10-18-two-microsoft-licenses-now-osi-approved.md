Am I blind, or is noone talking about [this](http://opensource.org/node/207)? Microsoft finally getting two approved official Open Source licenses is big news. With the approval the two licenses are being renamed:

Microsoft Permissive License (MS-PL) -> [Microsoft Public License](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/publiclicense.mspx) (MS-PL) 

Microsoft Community License (MS-CL) -> [Microsoft Reciprocal License](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/reciprocallicense.mspx) (MS-RL) 

via [sburke](http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2007/10/17/osi-approves-microsoft-shared-source-licenses.aspx), and now numerous other MSDN blogs now as well.

Seriously this must be being treated pretty low key, it's certainly not being trumpeted from the towers like it should. I heard many pundits say it would never happen...
