[Stephen Griffen](http://blogs.msdn.com/stephen_griffin) over at MSDN as discovered an easter egg in [LEGO Star Wars II](http://lucasarts.com/games/legostarwarsii/).  The [Santa Clause code](http://www.rebelscum.com/story/front/LEGO_Star_Wars_II_Easter_Christmas_Egg_102422.asp) was already known, but he [discovered a Rudolph Code (using strings no less)!](http://blogs.msdn.com/stephen_griffin/archive/2006/12/23/lego-star-wars-ii-rudolph-the-red-nose-jedi.aspx)  He's asking for your help getting a screenshot, so leave him a comment with a link to one if you can.
