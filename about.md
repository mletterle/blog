The Prokrammer also responds to the name Michael Letterle.  He's currently a developer with [PreEmptive Solutions](http://www.preemptive.com).  He enjoys programming in C#/.NET and hacks at Ruby in his free time.  He's also uncomfortable about referring to himself in the third person and is quite done working on this page.  He may update it later.
